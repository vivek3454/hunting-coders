    "introduction": "Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side. It provides a versatile and efficient platform for building various types of applications, from web servers and APIs to command-line tools and real-time applications. What sets Node.js apart is its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which enables it to handle multiple connections and operations simultaneously without blocking the execution of other tasks. This makes Node.js particularly well-suited for applications that require high concurrency and responsiveness. With its extensive ecosystem of packages and modules available through the Node Package Manager (npm), developers can easily leverage third-party tools and libraries to streamline their development process. Node.js has gained widespread popularity for its performance, scalability, and the ability to unify front-end and back-end development using a single programming languageâ€”JavaScript.",
