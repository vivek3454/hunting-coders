    "introduction": "React is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs) and user interface components for web applications. It was developed by Facebook and is widely used in the web development community. React allows developers to create reusable UI components that update efficiently and automatically as the application's state changes. It follows a declarative approach, meaning you describe how your UI should look based on the current state, and React takes care of updating the UI when the state changes.",
